    <h1><center>UNHEALTHY FOOD</center></h1>
    <p>Everyone has those foods that they crave constantly. If you have a sweet tooth, you might dream of cupcakes, frosting, sprinkles, or milkshakes. Or maybe you're more of a savory salt-lover who can't wait to get their hands on a bag of chips, an order of French fries, or a crispy piece of bacon. All foods are okay in moderation, but some are downright unhealthy due to their sketchy ingredients or lack of nutrients, and those are the ones you'll want to avoid consuming regularly. Many of them may even be considered the unhealthiest foods on the planetâ€”culprits that may be wreaking havoc on your well-being without you even realizing it.</p>
